I used this commands in Git Bash to add MSEI SIS to my empty Github repository: 
---
git init
-to create a new empty repository
---
git add . or git add 'name of file'
- add . adds all the files to the given directory while specifiyng name is used to add specified files
---
git status
- used to see 'status' (shows which files are changed)
---
git commit -m 'some message'
we use this to commit changes and -m is use 'note' about the changes
---
git remote add origin 'url'
-to specify the url of repository to which our folder will be pushed
---
git push -u origin master
-used to push to the 'commits'to the remote repository.
